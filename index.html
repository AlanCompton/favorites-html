    <p>My name is Alan. I'm from a small town in Alabama. I'm currently in the military and I have been to many different countries. My favorite country to visit by far has been Japan. I'm 23 and have a few cats. I've recently been married and have a baby on the way. I am exited to move toward a future where I enjoy my job and have flexibility to do lots of different work.</p>
